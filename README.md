# MyApp
 
A flutter app that allows users to track water intake based off of their information such as height. Users can set a goal or have the app set the goal for water intake

# Currently

This app has a basic user interface that allows the user to see the logo of the app and the ability to scroll and input their name and weight.

# Next steps

The next implementation is to be able to store user data in a database, ability to create hydration reports, and visualize hydration goals
